This will scale best with Version 2 QR codes. V1 codes can be hard to scan due to the lack of an alignment pattern, and due to the watch’s low-resolution display you may have a hard time scanning V3 or higher codes. Version 2 QR codes can hold 39-74 numeric characters, 24-45 alphanumeric (0–9, A–Z upper-case only, space, $, %, *, +, -, ., /, :) or 17-31 characters if you use any other letters or symbols.</string>
